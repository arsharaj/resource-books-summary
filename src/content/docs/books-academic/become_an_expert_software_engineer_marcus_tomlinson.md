### Chapter 1 : Reprogramming yourself for success

**Step 1 - Be proud to be an engineer**

* As a software engineer, your impact on the world is more significant than you might think.
* This book is aimed at anyone with an interest in writing software.
* Without interest in what you do, you will not have the motivation required to succeed.
* Choose a job you love, and you will want to work everyday of your life.

**Step 2 - Prepare to work for what you want**

* The only valueable form of experience is the kind you've worked for and can demonstrate.
* This is not a get rich quick scheme, working smart doesn't necessarily replace working hard.
* If your job does not leave you proud after a hard day's work, you need to find one that does.

**Step 3 - Take the dream out of dream job**

* Many of us direct frustration towards our field of work, rather than the job that drove us there.
* Aim high, reach for your dream job, and believe in yourself.
* Get the work experience you need by programming in your space time.
* Find a job that will be a perfect fit for you, then work on making yourself perfectly fit for it.

**Step 4 - Put your software where your mouth is**

* Your resume should contain hard evidence that proves you meet a job's requirements.
* Prove your proficiency in a skill by writing free and open source software to demonstrate it.
* Don't let money enter into the motivation you have for your dream job.
* Show your appreciation to open source by contributing well-written, helpful software.

**Step 5 - Understand what it takes to be an expert**

* Expertise is more often than not measured in the time you've spent deliberately practicing.
* It takes around 20 hours of deliberate practice to learn almost anything.
* It takes around 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to become an expert in almost anything.

### Chapter 2 : Choosing which technologies and domains to focus on

**Step 1 - Visualise yourself in your dream job**

* You should be putting time into practicing the specific set of skills required for your dream job.
* Every piece of code you add to your resume should be an investmest into your future.
* Visualise your dream job and write down as many key characteristics you envision it to have.

**Step 2 - Look for companies that interest you**

* Decide on which problem domain to focus on.
* Use LinkedIn.com to find the kinds of companies you're interested in.
* If enough companies within a particular problem domain don't interest you, pick another.
* Add any interesting technologies and subdomains you encounter to your list from step 1.

**Step 3 - Look for jobs that interest you**

* Decide on which technologies and subdomains to focus on.
* Use job search engines to find the kinds of jobs you're interested in.
* If enough jobs within a particular problem domain don't interest you, pick another.
* Add any interesting technologies and subdomains you encounter to your list from step 2.

**Step 4 - Define a specific career goal**

* Jobs for a particular specialisation are, for the most part, cut from the same mould.
* Mark duplicate entries on your list with an asterisk as these will almost certainly be required.
* Most technologies and subdomains that appear only once can be filtered out.

**Step 5 - Get your priorities straight**

* Assign each item on your list an interest level rating out of 10.
* Add to each item a rating out of 5 on how much previous experience you've had with it.
* Split asterisked and non-asterisked items, then rearrange each set according to total score.
* Recombine the list with asterisked items at the top and non-asterisked items at tht bottom.
