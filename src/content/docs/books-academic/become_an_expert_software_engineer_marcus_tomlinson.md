### Chapter 1 : Reprogramming yourself for success

**Step 1 - Be proud to be an engineer**

* As a software engineer, your impact on the world is more significant than you might think.
* This book is aimed at anyone with an interest in writing software.
* Without interest in what you do, you will not have the motivation required to succeed.
* Choose a job you love, and you will want to work everyday of your life.

**Step 2 - Prepare to work for what you want**

* The only valueable form of experience is the kind you've worked for and can demonstrate.
* This is not a get rich quick scheme, working smart doesn't necessarily replace working hard.
* If your job does not leave you proud after a hard day's work, you need to find one that does.

**Step 3 - Take the dream out of dream job**

* Many of us direct frustration towards our field of work, rather than the job that drove us there.
* Aim high, reach for your dream job, and believe in yourself.
* Get the work experience you need by programming in your space time.
* Find a job that will be a perfect fit for you, then work on making yourself perfectly fit for it.

**Step 4 - Put your software where your mouth is**

* Your resume should contain hard evidence that proves you meet a job's requirements.
* Prove your proficiency in a skill by writing free and open source software to demonstrate it.
* Don't let money enter into the motivation you have for your dream job.
* Show your appreciation to open source by contributing well-written, helpful software.

**Step 5 - Understand what it takes to be an expert**

* Expertise is more often than not measured in the time you've spent deliberately practicing.
* It takes around 20 hours of deliberate practice to learn almost anything.
* It takes around 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to become an expert in almost anything.

### Chapter 2 : Choosing which technologies and domains to focus on

**Step 1 - Visualise yourself in your dream job**

* You should be putting time into practicing the specific set of skills required for your dream job.
* Every piece of code you add to your resume should be an investmest into your future.
* Visualise your dream job and write down as many key characteristics you envision it to have.

**Step 2 - Look for companies that interest you**

* Decide on which problem domain to focus on.
* Use LinkedIn.com to find the kinds of companies you're interested in.
* If enough companies within a particular problem domain don't interest you, pick another.
* Add any interesting technologies and subdomains you encounter to your list from step 1.

**Step 3 - Look for jobs that interest you**

* Decide on which technologies and subdomains to focus on.
* Use job search engines to find the kinds of jobs you're interested in.
* If enough jobs within a particular problem domain don't interest you, pick another.
* Add any interesting technologies and subdomains you encounter to your list from step 2.

**Step 4 - Define a specific career goal**

* Jobs for a particular specialisation are, for the most part, cut from the same mould.
* Mark duplicate entries on your list with an asterisk as these will almost certainly be required.
* Most technologies and subdomains that appear only once can be filtered out.

**Step 5 - Get your priorities straight**

* Assign each item on your list an interest level rating out of 10.
* Add to each item a rating out of 5 on how much previous experience you've had with it.
* Split asterisked and non-asterisked items, then rearrange each set according to total score.
* Recombine the list with asterisked items at the top and non-asterisked items at tht bottom.

### Chapter 3 : Coming up with a good project idea

**Step 1 - Pick a concentrated subject matter**

* Projects fail when they do not deliver on what they promise.
* Rather do simple well, than complex badly.
* Try to concentrate on showcasing just the top item on your list from the previous chapter.

**Step 2 - Look for problems that need solving**

* Software is created to solve problems, hence problems are a great source of inspiration.
* Regardless of what you're making, at least some of your time will be spent developing its API.
* Use stackoverflow.com to find common issues associated with your subject matter.

**Step 3 - Look for gaps that need filling**

* Learning from those who came before you is another great source of inspiration.
* Your aim should be to bring something new to the table.
* Use sourceforge.net to find popular projects associated with your subject matter.
* Note down any aspects that people particularly like or dislike about them from the reviews.

**Step 4 - Decide whether to create or contribute**

* A major advantage to creating is the educational benefit of developing a solution end-to-end.
* A major advantage to contributing is that it can add value to the company you're applying to.
* I lean towards creating as its advantages are greater, and its disadvantages can be avoided.
* All you need to create good software is a personal interest in seeing the problem solved.

**Step 5 - Establish a clear objective**

* Gather your notes from this chapter and identify common themes or directions.
* Come up with some one-liner descriptions of a few project ideas from the above themes.
* Pick the one that you feel you'd hove the most fun with, and ignore the rest for now.

### Chapter 4 : Designing your product

**Step 1 - Come up with a good name**

* It's more motivating to work on something that feels real, than to invest in the imaginary.
* Your project's title should convey an idea of what it does, and should be easy to remember.
* Use sourceforge.net to find similar projects, then brainstorm how yours could stand out.
* Put together a cover image that is simple and will subtly convey a sense of professionalism.

**Step 2 - Write up a project summary**

* Your product summary should be descriptive, unique, discoverable, and marketable.
* Use adwords.google.com to identify popular keywords for use in your summary.
* Formulate an elevator pitch for your project that is both brief and detailed at the same time.

**Step 3 - Create a product wish list**

* Use the problems and gaps that wound up under your project idea to form a product wish list.
* Write each high-level feature as if you were an end-user requesting it from the developer.
* Also assemble a "not" list containing features that do not fall within the scope of the project.

**Step 4 - Add research to your design**

* You should aim for just enough research to enable you to create smart, simple solutions.
* You have to grasp the "what" completely before you can determine the "how" and "why".
* Assign each item in your product wish list a research requirement rating out of 5.

**Step 5 - Plan a viable release schedule**

* The only variable force in software development is scope.
* Adjusting scope between releases allows you to deliver software on time, and on budget.
* A deadline is really the time in which you have to get as many features done as possible.
* Arrange your wish list in order of importance from highest to lowest.
* As you complete each feature, you should be able to release a new, fully-functional version.

### Chapter 5 : Setting up an open source project

**Step 1 - Pick an open source license**

* With free software, the definition of "free" depends on the license used.
* Understanding licenses is useful in licensing your own projects, as well as integrating others.
* Credit to the original author is honoured by complying with the appropriate license terms.
* Protection of trademark is honoured in much the same way that credit to the original author is.
* A license may or may not be compatible with other free or proprietary licenses.
* Protection against patent law grants all users free licenses to any patents used legally in the project.
* Stick with the Apache, BSD, MIT and LGPL (when it makes sense in a library) licenses.
* For more information on these licenses and their variations, see : opensource.org/licenses.

**Step 2 - Pick a version control system**

* You will not be taken seriously if your project's source is not managed by version control.
* A detailed project development history is almost mandatory in producing successful software.
* Choose a VCS that is popular to portray a sense of professionalism and familiarity to others.
* See the wikipedia article : Comparison of source code hosting facilities for popular VCS's.

**Step 3 - Pick a canned hosting site**

* Avoid the headache of constructing a complex project website by using canned hosting.
* See the wikipedia article : Comparison of source code hosting facilities for popular hosting sites.
* You could even create multiple pages for your project across more than one hosting site.

**Step 4 - Pick a web hosting site**

* Your project will be taken more seriously if it has its own dedicated website as well.
* Registering a domain name is optional, but you will at least need to register a web hosting plan.
* Use a document generator to create API documentation for your website.
* See the wikipedia article : Comparison of documentation generators.
* Writing documentation alongside your code means that it too will be stored in VCS.

**Step 5 - Create and configure your project**

* The act of creating a project page signifies that project's inception.
* Browse to your chosen canned hosting site, sign up and create a new project.
* Enable the bug tracker and add your wish list items to it.
* Enable the VCS and initialize a new "trunk" or "master" branch.

### Chapter 6 : Managing a part time work schedule

**Step 1 - Divide and conquer**

* Focus your energy on solving just the top item of your release schedule from chapter 4.
* The problems we face are naturally complex i.e. can be broken down into smaller tasks.
* First and foremost, you should create a task for research.
* As long as your current task is well defined, the rest can be reevaluated as you go.
* Start with a generic list of tasks such as : define api, write tests and implement back end.

**Step 2 - Practice time management**

* Good time management is a fundamental skill that every engineer should possess.
* It is far too easy to procrastinate without a manager, or a team depending on you.
* In software development, work is quantified in terms of complexity.
* The complexity of a problem is directly proportional to the time required to solve it.
* Calculate your work rate by assigning a complexity rating of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 8 to each task.

**Step 3 - Avoid distractions**

* While procrastinating can delay your software, distractions can kill it.
* There are two major forms of distraction you should avoid : physical and digital.
* If by solving one problem you uncover another, postpone it to a seperate task for later.
* Avoid premature optimisation.

**Step 4 - Don't rush**

* Rushing a task to completion is just as harmful as taking too long to complete it.
* Put your hobbies on hold, work whenever you can and avoid taking breaks longer than a week.
* Try to plan a work schedule that exceeds 20 hours.

**Step 5 - Enjoy yourself**

* "Professional" development does not necessarily have to mean "boring" development.
* At the very least, just try to make your code as readable as possible.
* Have fun, be easy on yourself, and be easy on your code.
