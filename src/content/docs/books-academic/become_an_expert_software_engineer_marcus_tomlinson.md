### Chapter 1 : Reprogramming yourself for success

**Step 1 - Be proud to be an engineer**

* As a software engineer, your impact on the world is more significant than you might think.
* This book is aimed at anyone with an interest in writing software.
* Without interest in what you do, you will not have the motivation required to succeed.
* Choose a job you love, and you will want to work everyday of your life.

**Step 2 - Prepare to work for what you want**

* The only valueable form of experience is the kind you've worked for and can demonstrate.
* This is not a get rich quick scheme, working smart doesn't necessarily replace working hard.
* If your job does not leave you proud after a hard day's work, you need to find one that does.

**Step 3 - Take the dream out of dream job**

* Many of us direct frustration towards our field of work, rather than the job that drove us there.
* Aim high, reach for your dream job, and believe in yourself.
* Get the work experience you need by programming in your space time.
* Find a job that will be a perfect fit for you, then work on making yourself perfectly fit for it.

**Step 4 - Put your software where your mouth is**

* Your resume should contain hard evidence that proves you meet a job's requirements.
* Prove your proficiency in a skill by writing free and open source software to demonstrate it.
* Don't let money enter into the motivation you have for your dream job.
* Show your appreciation to open source by contributing well-written, helpful software.

**Step 5 - Understand what it takes to be an expert**

* Expertise is more often than not measured in the time you've spent deliberately practicing.
* It takes around 20 hours of deliberate practice to learn almost anything.
* It takes around 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to become an expert in almost anything.

### Chapter 2 : Choosing which technologies and domains to focus on

**Step 1 - Visualise yourself in your dream job**

* You should be putting time into practicing the specific set of skills required for your dream job.
* Every piece of code you add to your resume should be an investmest into your future.
* Visualise your dream job and write down as many key characteristics you envision it to have.

**Step 2 - Look for companies that interest you**

* Decide on which problem domain to focus on.
* Use LinkedIn.com to find the kinds of companies you're interested in.
* If enough companies within a particular problem domain don't interest you, pick another.
* Add any interesting technologies and subdomains you encounter to your list from step 1.

**Step 3 - Look for jobs that interest you**

* Decide on which technologies and subdomains to focus on.
* Use job search engines to find the kinds of jobs you're interested in.
* If enough jobs within a particular problem domain don't interest you, pick another.
* Add any interesting technologies and subdomains you encounter to your list from step 2.

**Step 4 - Define a specific career goal**

* Jobs for a particular specialisation are, for the most part, cut from the same mould.
* Mark duplicate entries on your list with an asterisk as these will almost certainly be required.
* Most technologies and subdomains that appear only once can be filtered out.

**Step 5 - Get your priorities straight**

* Assign each item on your list an interest level rating out of 10.
* Add to each item a rating out of 5 on how much previous experience you've had with it.
* Split asterisked and non-asterisked items, then rearrange each set according to total score.
* Recombine the list with asterisked items at the top and non-asterisked items at tht bottom.

### Chapter 3 : Coming up with a good project idea

**Step 1 - Pick a concentrated subject matter**

* Projects fail when they do not deliver on what they promise.
* Rather do simple well, than complex badly.
* Try to concentrate on showcasing just the top item on your list from the previous chapter.

**Step 2 - Look for problems that need solving**

* Software is created to solve problems, hence problems are a great source of inspiration.
* Regardless of what you're making, at least some of your time will be spent developing its API.
* Use stackoverflow.com to find common issues associated with your subject matter.

**Step 3 - Look for gaps that need filling**

* Learning from those who came before you is another great source of inspiration.
* Your aim should be to bring something new to the table.
* Use sourceforge.net to find popular projects associated with your subject matter.
* Note down any aspects that people particularly like or dislike about them from the reviews.

**Step 4 - Decide whether to create or contribute**

* A major advantage to creating is the educational benefit of developing a solution end-to-end.
* A major advantage to contributing is that it can add value to the company you're applying to.
* I lean towards creating as its advantages are greater, and its disadvantages can be avoided.
* All you need to create good software is a personal interest in seeing the problem solved.

**Step 5 - Establish a clear objective**

* Gather your notes from this chapter and identify common themes or directions.
* Come up with some one-liner descriptions of a few project ideas from the above themes.
* Pick the one that you feel you'd hove the most fun with, and ignore the rest for now.

### Chapter 4 : Designing your product

**Step 1 - Come up with a good name**

* It's more motivating to work on something that feels real, than to invest in the imaginary.
* Your project's title should convey an idea of what it does, and should be easy to remember.
* Use sourceforge.net to find similar projects, then brainstorm how yours could stand out.
* Put together a cover image that is simple and will subtly convey a sense of professionalism.

**Step 2 - Write up a project summary**

* Your product summary should be descriptive, unique, discoverable, and marketable.
* Use adwords.google.com to identify popular keywords for use in your summary.
* Formulate an elevator pitch for your project that is both brief and detailed at the same time.

**Step 3 - Create a product wish list**

* Use the problems and gaps that wound up under your project idea to form a product wish list.
* Write each high-level feature as if you were an end-user requesting it from the developer.
* Also assemble a "not" list containing features that do not fall within the scope of the project.

**Step 4 - Add research to your design**

* You should aim for just enough research to enable you to create smart, simple solutions.
* You have to grasp the "what" completely before you can determine the "how" and "why".
* Assign each item in your product wish list a research requirement rating out of 5.

**Step 5 - Plan a viable release schedule**

* The only variable force in software development is scope.
* Adjusting scope between releases allows you to deliver software on time, and on budget.
* A deadline is really the time in which you have to get as many features done as possible.
* Arrange your wish list in order of importance from highest to lowest.
* As you complete each feature, you should be able to release a new, fully-functional version.
