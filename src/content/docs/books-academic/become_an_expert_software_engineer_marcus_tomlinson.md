### Chapter 1 : Reprogramming yourself for success

**Step 1 - Be proud to be an engineer**

* As a software engineer, your impact on the world is more significant than you might think.
* This book is aimed at anyone with an interest in writing software.
* Without interest in what you do, you will not have the motivation required to succeed.
* Choose a job you love, and you will want to work everyday of your life.

**Step 2 - Prepare to work for what you want**

* The only valueable form of experience is the kind you've worked for and can demonstrate.
* This is not a get rich quick scheme, working smart doesn't necessarily replace working hard.
* If your job does not leave you proud after a hard day's work, you need to find one that does.

**Step 3 - Take the dream out of dream job**

* Many of us direct frustration towards our field of work, rather than the job that drove us there.
* Aim high, reach for your dream job, and believe in yourself.
* Get the work experience you need by programming in your space time.
* Find a job that will be a perfect fit for you, then work on making yourself perfectly fit for it.

**Step 4 - Put your software where your mouth is**

* Your resume should contain hard evidence that proves you meet a job's requirements.
* Prove your proficiency in a skill by writing free and open source software to demonstrate it.
* Don't let money enter into the motivation you have for your dream job.
* Show your appreciation to open source by contributing well-written, helpful software.

**Step 5 - Understand what it takes to be an expert**

* Expertise is more often than not measured in the time you've spent deliberately practicing.
* It takes around 20 hours of deliberate practice to learn almost anything.
* It takes around 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to become an expert in almost anything.
